# Chess.com 2024 Journey Dashboard  

## Overview  
This project is a personal exploration of my Chess.com games played throughout 2024. Using interactive dashboards, I analyzed my performance, strategies, and milestones across different chess metrics. The project serves as both a reflection on my journey and a data visualization exercise.  

## Key Features  
- **Performance Analysis by Piece**  
  - *Pawn*: Elo progression over time, game types played, and wins against stronger opponents.  
  - *Knight*: Game patterns by week, longest win streak, and opponent ratings analysis.  
  - *Bishop*: Insights into performance against opponent Elo bins, game length by result, and opening moves analysis.  
  - *Rook*: Breakdown of wins, draws, and losses by reason; gameplay strategies as White and Black.  
  - *Queen*: Focus on the most common openings and their respective performances.  
  - *King*: Overall year summary, top openings, and win/loss trends.  

## Tools and Technologies  
- **Data Source**: Exported game data from Chess.com.  
- **Visualization**: Tableau for interactive dashboards.  
- **Development Tools**: Python for data preprocessing and GitHub for project management.
